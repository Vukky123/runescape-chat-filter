# runescape-chat-filter
A terrible attempt by a guy that hasn't used RegEx before to filter spam messages in your OSRS chat.

## How to use?
You can use this chat filter with [RuneLite](https://runelite.net)'s Chat Filter plugin.

### Getting the filter
You can find the latest version of the filter [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vukky123/runescape-chat-filter/main/filter).

### Installing the filter
Paste it into the "Filtered Regex" section of the Chat Filter plugin's settings, and you're good to go!

*It's also recommended to set your Filter type to **Remove Message**, so messages flagged by the filter will not show up in chat.*
